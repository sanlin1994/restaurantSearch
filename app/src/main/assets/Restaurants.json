"comments":"Mission Chinese Food has grown up from its scrappy Orchard Street days into a big, two story restaurant equipped with a pizza oven, a prime rib cart, and a much broader menu. Yes, it still has all the hits — the kung pao pastrami, the thrice cooked bacon —but chef/proprietor Danny Bowien and executive chef Angela Dimayuga have also added a raw bar, twogenerous family-style set menus, and showstoppers like duck baked in clay. And you can still get a lot of food without breaking the bank."

"comments":"This place is a blast. Must orders: GREEN TEA NOODS, sounds gross (to me at least) but these were incredible!, Kung pao pastrami (but you already knew that), beef tartare was a fun appetizer that we decided to try, the spicy ma po tofu SUPER spicy but delicious, egg rolls and scallion pancake i could have passed on... I wish we would have gone with a larger group, so much more I would have liked to try!"

"comments":"I was VERY excited to come here after seeing and hearing so many good things about this place. Having read much, I knew goinginto it that it was not going to be authentic Chinese. The place was edgy, had a punk rock throwback attitude, and generally delivered the desired atmosphere. Things went downhill from there though. The food was okay at best and the best qualities were easily overshadowed by what I believe to be poordecisions by the kitchen staff."

"comments":"This cozy Clinton Hill restaurant excels at both straightforward and unusual wood-fired pizzas. If you want a taste of the latter, consider ordering the Emily, which is topped with mozzarella, pistachios, truffled sottocenere cheese, and honey. The menu includes salads and a handful of starters, as well as a burger that some meat connoisseurs consider to be among the best in the city."

"comments":"5 star atmosphere as it is very cozy with great staff. 5 star food as their Emmy burger is outrageously good. and it's on apretzel bun.. Too juicy for its own good and downright addicting. Also try the Colony pizza. Many others looked like worthy competitors, but the Colony really found its way to my heart. When you start with a great crust, top it with top notch cheese and sauce, you've got a winner. But, if you go a step further and add the salty from the pepperoni, the sweet from the honey, and the spicy from the chili oil.... your mouth is confused and happy at the same time."
